		<h3>More Stuff About Me</h3>
		<p>For 10 years I've been wiring and installing AV systems and alarm systems at a small company here in Lubbock. It's been a great job with a great boss, but I really love coding!</p>
		<p>I haven't done much yet, but now that I'm a student at Thinkful, I'm on my way to making it my everyday thing in a new career. Super excited about working and collaborating with others on that!</p>
		<p>Feel free to Contact Me with any questions or helpful tips about my new journey.</p>
